Link to LIVE WEBSITE at pythonanywhere! : https://mnd1616.pythonanywhere.com/

When inputting RNA sequences for G-enzyme and CU-enzyme please be sure to enter everything in all caps seperated by comma and space after the comma. 
I.E.
G-Enzyme split : AUCG, AUG, G, CU, ACUAUACG 
CU-enzyme split : GGAC, U, AU, GAU, C, U, AC, GC, AU

Returns will be : ['AUGAUCGGACUAUACGCU', 'AUCGAUGGACUAUACGCU', 'AUGGACUAUACGAUCGCU', 'AUCGGACUAUACGAUGCU']
